    SCOUT MASTER: FILE EXAMPLE

    This file allows modifications to the "scout master" that you can see when character scouting.
    To implement your own "scout master", make a copy of this file and modify the values as you please.

    When you're done, to implement it you change the <ScoutMaster> value in your Settings.xml file to
    the file name of your new ScoutMaster file.

    i.e:
        A ScoutMaster file with the name 'Argo.xml' should appear as '<ScoutMaster>Argo</ScoutMaster>' in your Settings.xml file
        or a ScoutMaster file with the name 'Ushi.xml' should appear as '<ScoutMaster>Ushi</ScoutMaster>' and so on.

<ScoutMaster>

        SCOUT MASTER: NAME

        Modifying the value below will change the name in the playing message
        when the bot is online.

        i.e:
            By default, the playing message will appear as "S'argo | $help";
            if the value was modified to be "coolBotName" then the playing message
            will appear as "coolBotName | $help".
    <-->
    <BotName name="S'argo"/>

        SCOUT MASTER: IMAGES

        ScoutMasters can support up to four images:
            - "Smile": Image when the highest rarity in a character scout is copper.
            - "Grin": Image when the highest rarity in a character scout is silver.
            - "Smug": Image when the highest rarity in a character scout is gold.
            - "Flowers": Image when the highest rarity in a character scout is platinum.

        Take note that even if the highest rarity in a character scout is platinum, the other images
        have a chance of appearing as well.

        By default, the image dimensions are 350x350, but any size should be supported.

        You may also use other file hosting sites like imgur for these images.
